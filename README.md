# Double User Guide

Double enables capital providers to earn 2x their return on positions in their favorite AMMs by providing liquidity within the Double protocol. To do this the protocol pairs token projects with Liquidity providers (LPs). 

To start, projects need to deposit their tokens in the Double Vault (see [Token](https://www.double2win.xyz/docs/Token.html)) and create a pair of their choice in their favorite AMM. This enables the LPs to supply the capital to pair with that liquidity. 

Since LPs donâ€™t need to provide any tokens in their position, Double drastically reduces token-side risk while enabling the remaining capital to be used as principle in the position. This gives the LP 2x the amount of capital for each position since they are simply borrowing the token side of the position.

Double regulates these returns with DDC NFTs. Each NFT enables LPs to create positions with a variable amount of capital into the protocol depending on market demand. Currently each DDC allows for $10,000 worth of capital. 

Double is permissionless and any token can be deposited into the protocol. This helps with scaling the protocol over time.
