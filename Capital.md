# Capital

## Create a New Position
The amount of Capital you are allowed to contribute is dependent on the DDC (Double Down Club NFTs) you have in your wallet ($10,000 per DDC is allowed). See the DDC/DDJ [LINK PAGE to text] page for more details.
You can create a liquidity position with any token in Double. 

However, the token must have a pool/pair on your selected AMM and also have tokens available in the Double Token Vault in order to be a valid pair. To learn how to add tokens to the double vault see the Deposit Tokens Section under the Token Page in this manual.

1. To start you need to check your Capital Allowance. 
2. Navigate to the DDC Page
3. If you are holding DDC in your wallet you will be able to deposit the DDC to the Smart Contract. 
4. Click the Dropdown Arrow.

⁃ Note: if you don’t have any DDC see the DDC page for more information

13. Click Add Liquidity to approve the transaction
14. Confirm the prompt from your wallet to sign the transaction.
15. You can view the progress, as well as the success or failure of the transaction in the block explorer popup once your transaction is submitted
