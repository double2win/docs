You can create a liquidity position with any token in Double.

4. Select or import the token from its contract address

7. Click **Add Liquidity **to approve the transaction
8. Confirm the prompt from your wallet to sign the transaction.
9. You can view the progress, as well as the success or failure of the transaction in the block explorer popup once your transaction is submitted
