# Basic Functions


## Network Selector

Double supports multiple blockchains and each blockchain has its own network to connect to your wallet. The Network Selector allows you to change from one blockchain to another along with various test nets to test the product before committing real cryptocurrency.  


## AMM Selector

The Automated Market Maker(AMM) selector allows you to switch between different AMMs like Uniswap or Sushiswap. 

If the token you are trying to provide liquidity for is only available on Uniswap, then you will need to select Uniswap from the dropdown before adding a new position. 

If you already have a position on Uniswap or Sushiswap you can use the AMM selector to match to your AMM and then import your position.
